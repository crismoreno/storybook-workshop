# Cristina Moreno ft. Assembler Institute of Technology

Hello dear developers to be!
I'm Cristina Moreno checkout [cristinamoreno.dev](https://www.cristinamoreno.dev/) to know more about me.

## What is this project about?

This is a project I set up for learning purposes.
It's a scaffolding of a components library made in: React + Ts + Styled Components + Tailwind + React Testing Library + Vite + Storybook.
It also contains a Button component for reference that includes its stories and test cases.

## How did I build this?

[I used this tutorial](https://www.kantega.no/blogg/setting-up-storybook-7-with-vite-and-tailwind-css) - Although the storybook command is outdate and should be replaced by: `npx storybook@latest init` This will set you up with Storybook, Vite and Tailwind.
I also checked out official documentation for the rest of the stack.
[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)

This also uses [HeroIcons](https://heroicons.com/)

I also used pnpm here because I came across this [issue](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/22431)
I replaced yarn by pnpm by doing [this](https://www.swarmion.dev/docs/how-to-guides/migration-guides/yarn-to-pnpm/)

## How can I run the project

First thing after cloning this repo should be `pnpm install`
You can launch the storybook by doing `pnpm storybook`
